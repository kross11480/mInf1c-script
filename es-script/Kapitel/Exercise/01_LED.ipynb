    "# Exercise 1: LED Chaser\n",
    "There are four LEDs in the Stefi Shield. The task is to \n",
    "* write a program which will blink the LEDs light in sequence from left to right and back again with a frequency of 1 Hz. This pattern creates the \"lauflicht\" effect where light appears to move back and forth between leds. \n",
    "* start and stop the LED chaser on push button press\n",
    "* debounce the button press\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the exercise is to practice following skills\n",
    "* reading schematics: how are the LEDs and Buttons connected to the microcontroller.\n",
    "* using interrupts: how does microcontroller react to button press.\n",
    "* modeling with state machines: how do i model the led chaser starting and stopping on button press.\n",
    "* handle real-world problems: there is no perfect switch or push-button (see Debouncing)"
